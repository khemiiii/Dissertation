    <h3 class="header3">OVERVIEW</h3>

    <p class="header3">The internet has become an essential part of modern life, yet its complexity makes it difficult to fully comprehend.
        As of January 2023, there were 5.16 billion internet users globally, accounting for 64.4 percent of the global population.
        Organisations such as ISPs, universities, and data centres, make use of an autonomous system (AS), which allows data to be transmitted over the internet.
        This application uses the AS-level data of the internet to perform analysis on its evolution. It includes tools that perform a variety of functions,
        which will be explored further below. Graphs, tables and charts have been used to provide a visual representation of how the number of ASs assigned evolved over time.
        This information is presented on the site's homepage, along with a chart showing the rise and fall of the overall number of connections,
        including the number of links based on the type of relationship agreement. The AS relationship agreement in the present analysis was
        limited to the Provider-Customer and Peer-Peer relationships acquired from the CAIDA website.</p>

    <h3 class="header3">TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS</h3>
    <p class="header3">The tools discussed below are ordered accordingly as the outlined buttons on the homepage.
        The analysis is based on the CAIDA infererred AS-relationship dataset from 1998-2022:</p>

    <p class="header3">1. Determination of the tier of an AS, and itâ€™s centrality measures within the graph of a specific year.
        The requirements for this tool include the ASN and the year of enquiry.</p>

    <p class="header3">2. Identification of the top 10 central ASs within a specific year.
        These ASs are of importance thus have high values in respect to their degree(how many neighbours/links they have),
        eigenvector(depends on the centrality of a node's neighbours) and betweenness(measures the optimal paths which connect through the node).</p>

    <p class="header3">3. Visualisation of the hierarchy of an AS using a graph and a list of the neighbours of an AS.
        If the hop cut-off is set to 1; thus showing only next-hop neighbours, the tool outputs the relationship agreement type the specific AS has with each neighbour.
        Otherwise, the table displays only the path that can be taken to reach that node.The requirements for this tool include the AS, hop cut-off number,
        and the specific year of interest.</p>

    <p class="header3">4. Computation of the network size for a given year and a graph is presented with a limited view of the provider ASs and nodes of inferred importance.</p>

    <p class="header3">5. Analysis of the data to extract the ASs that joined the internet given two different years.</p>

    <p class="header3">6. Examination of the data to show the ASs that were removed from the network within two years of interest.</p>

    <h3 class="header3">AIM</h3>

    <p class="header3">The visualisation of the internet project aims to broaden individuals' understanding of the internet's evolution and structure.
        It also serves as a platform for additional study of the network's current state in order to develop recommendations for its enhancement.</p>
